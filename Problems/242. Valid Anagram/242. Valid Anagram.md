# 242. Valid Anagram

Problem is quite simple to understand, we are given two strings, s and t, we need to check if they are anagrams, meaning that if they have the exact same letters, whatever word they may form (in any order). 

---

Initially, we can't just directly work on strings to see if they are equal, because the order is not same, so to check the order t be same, we can just sort the strings, and check if they are equal. 

Which is at core our solution, but we can do this sort in two ways:

One is converting the string into an array of characters, literally, and then sorting the array uing sort, and then comparing both the arrays.

Other solution which I found was to use a sorted() function directly on the strings and check their equality.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        arr1 = []
        arr2 = []
        for char in s:
            arr1.append(char)
        for char in t:
            arr2.append(char)
        arr1.sort()
        arr2.sort()
        if arr1==arr2:
            return True
        return False
```

The sorted() function solution is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if sorted(s) == sorted(t):
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Both the solutions have bad memory complexity, due to the usage of extra array space, and time complexity of O(nlogn), they re almost same with just differing on how the sorting is being done.

---

We can use the hash tables to understand what are the characters and their count that makes up the anagram, so that way we can just compare one strings key value pairs against each other in O(n) time, as each look up is almost linear time, but this still leads to using extra space.

Whilst working through the code, my approach didn't consider for the second string not having the characters in first string, which gives out a key error, which can be averted by an if condition to check if it the key exists in second string or not.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        hashStr1= {}
        hashStr2= {}
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        # creating char-count hash tables
        for char in s:
            if char in hashStr1:
                hashStr1[char] += 1
            else:
                hashStr1[char] = 1
        for char in t:
            if char in hashStr2:
                hashStr2[char] += 1
            else:
                hashStr2[char] = 1
        # checking if the char-count hash tables match
        for key in hashStr1:
            if key not in hashStr2 or hashStr1[key] != hashStr2[key]:
                return False
        return True
```
