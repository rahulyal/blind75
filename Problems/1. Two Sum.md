# 1. Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

---

### Read and understand the problem

An array of integer elements, where there can be repeated integer values, but two elements in that array add up to a target value, which is given to us. 

These two element's position in the given array should be returned as an 2 element array

---

### Approach towards the solution you want to code

#### Brute Force solution:

Just write down a loop that runs through every element, and a second loop which through every element after that.

Code: tested in Python Tutor

```python
def TwoSum(nums, target):
    i = 0
    # loop 1 as explained in approach
    for num1 in nums:
        j = i+1    
        # loop 2 to check every element after the loop 1 element
        for num2 in nums[j:]:
            # checking condition
            if num1 + num2 == target:
                return [i,j]
            j += 1
        i += 1
    return None
    
nums = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9
ans = TwoSum(nums, target)
print(ans)

# all three testcases worked
# [3,2,4],[6,6] - target = 6
```
